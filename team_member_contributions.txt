Patrick worked primarily with Baxter in the physical world, writing the python scripts to interface with the inverse kinematics solver, gripper, and head camera.  He also implemented the capacity to offset the coordinates of the inverse kinematic solver along an arbitrary axis, allowing for moving the tool tip to any valid location in space.
