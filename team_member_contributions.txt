Patrick worked primarily with Baxter in the physical world, writing the python scripts to interface with the inverse kinematics solver, gripper, and head camera.  He also implemented the capacity to offset the coordinates of the inverse kinematic solver along an arbitrary axis, allowing for moving the tool tip to any valid location in space.  
Valerie worked in the intersection of real and simulation Baxter, writing the algorithm to detect the length of the tool that Baxter has picked up as well as working on getting the simulation environment up (incorporating the tool into the Baxter model) as well as making multiple iterations through training experiments.
